But this weekend Sarah's writer group came over to our house for a \"writer's retreat.\" They all have nearly finished books.

I tried to stay out of their way other than joining them for dinner. Over one of these dinners it came out that a friend of a friend had done a solo writing retreat at our house last year while we were out of town.":"But this weekend Sarah's writers' group came over to our house for a \"writers' retreat\".
